## Explanation

Yeah, so for this one, I was actually a little lazy to an thorough analysis
of the inputs to come up with a smart solution. Therefore, the thing is basically
just brute-forcing its way until the end.
Nevertheless, I'm feeling quite good about the actual simple implementation
and the neat addition of a `wrong configuration cache`.

I might port this code in the future to Rust, but for know the Python script
is more than sufficient.
