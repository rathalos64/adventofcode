## Explanation

The Christmas saving story gets cuter on each day. This time, I've used Python
once again because of their built-in generator functionality. Using this allowed
me to retain one function for both exercises. The logic behind the octo flashes
was a little tricky but solveable after a couple of minutes of thought.

Gonna try using Rust for the next exercise once again.
